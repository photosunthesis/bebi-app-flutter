An app I made for me and my girlfriend to keep track of stuff and share moments together. Built with **Flutter**. 💙

## What we use it for

- 📅 **Shared Calendar**: Keep track of important dates and events together
- 📸 **Stories**: Daily photo dumps of random stuff (🚧 WIP)
- 🌸 **Cycle Tracking**: Track periods and symptoms with AI-generated insights
- 📍 **Location Sharing**: See where the other person is when needed (🚧 WIP)

More features coming soon-ish (depending on what else we'll need from this app)

## Architecture

Built with Flutter and Firebase, using BLoC for state management and dependency injection via `get_it` + `injectable`. The AI insights are powered by Gemini through the `firebase_ai` package. Notable Firebase packages used include `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `cloud_functions`, `firebase_storage`, `firebase_analytics`, and `firebase_crashlytics`. Media and large uploads (photos/videos) are stored in Cloudflare R2. Other notable packages include `go_router` for navigation, `hive` for local storage, and `super_editor` for rich text editing.
